# Random-Music-Generator
This uses Markov chains to generate the pitches of notes.  Generatorv1 uses hard-coded if statements to show a simpler version of how the algorithm works, while Generatorv2 utilizes an adaptable algorithm that can support scales of any size.  Generatorv3 is an extension of v2, but it creates songs basaed off of patterns of notes, allowing for more repetetive songs.
